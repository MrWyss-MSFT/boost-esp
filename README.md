# boost-esp
This is a **proof of concept**, if setting Best_performance mode and disabling sleep during the Enrollment Status Page decreases the deploy time and avoids the devices going into sleep mode.


## [Install-ESPBoost.ps1](Install-ESPBoost.ps1) 

registers a **scheduled task**, that runs as **system**. It has a trigger on **system startup**. It **runs a powershell script** that is hosted **online**. In this case the [Boost-ESP.ps1](Boost-ESP.ps1) script. The scheduled task **expires** and therefore destroys itself after a given period of time. 

⚠️⚠️ **_replace change the URI to your version of Boost-ESP.ps1_** I don't want to system privileges on your system, fork the repository.

All the **$PSDefaultParameterValues** are for you to change

```powershell
$PSDefaultParameterValues = @{
    "Install-ScheduledTask:Uri"               = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrWyss-MSFT/boost-esp/main/Boost-ESP.ps1"
    "Install-ScheduledTask:TimeToLiveInHours" = 6
    "Install-ScheduledTask:Author"            = "MrWyss-MSFT"
    "Install-ScheduledTask:TaskName"          = "Boost-ESP"
}
```
This script is meant to be added in Endpoint Admin Manager admin center (Intune) _Devices | Scripts_. Simply upload the **modifed** script and assign it to your e.g. autopilot devices. Once run, usually early on in the Enrollment Status Page (ESP), it registers the scheduled task which in turn, runs the other script specified in Install-ScheduledTask:Uri every boot.

## [Boost-ESP.ps1](Boost-ESP.ps1)
This script goal is to configure **two** power related settings, **while** the device is in **ESP**. It will save the original values to the registry and reverts back to them, once the machine is out of the ESP.

1️⃣ set power mode to **Best performance**

2️⃣ and the **sleep** settings when plugged in aka **AC** to **never**

![Sleep settings](doc/pictures/sleep.png)

- Power Mode to Best performance is to speed up the deployment. e.g. Autopilot
- Sleep timeout to never is to avoid devices going to sleep, which usually breaks the ESP flow and can't be aborted.


There a few customization you can make in the script, remember you need to __host this file on your own__.
```powershell
#region vars
$modes = @{ 
    # These power mode guid's may be different on some devices
    "Battery_saver_or_Recommended" = [guid] "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    "Better_performance"           = [guid] "3af9b8d9-7c97-431d-ad78-34a8bfea439f"
    "Best_performance"             = [guid] "ded574b5-45a0-4f42-8737-46345c09c238" 
}

$DesiredModeGuid = $modes.Best_performance.Guid
$DesiredSleepTimeoutOnACInMinutes = 0 

$PSDefaultParameterValues = @{
    "*-Config:RegPath"        = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Boost-ESP"
    "Write-Log:Path"          = $env:ALLUSERSPROFILE + "\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs\Boost-Esp-$(Get-Date -Format yyyy-M-dd).log"
    "Write-Log:Component"     = "Boost-ESP"
    "Write-Log:Type"          = "Info"
    "Write-Log:ConsoleOutput" = $True
}
#endregion
```

You might have different mode guids for different oem devices. I am not sure about this yet.
Registry Path as to where it saves the original power settings values.

The log file is best readable with **OneTrace** as it uses a monospaces font.

## ToDo
- [ ] Better ESP completion test, this is currently hit and miss
- [ ] Win11 test and screenshot
- [ ] Test with SkipUserStatusPage
